Hi, I'm Aakash Bolisetty! 👋

I'm a data engineer specializing in SQL and Python, with extensive experience building and maintaining data pipelines on Snowflake and Databricks. My passion lies in translating complex data into actionable insights and scalable solutions.

Some of my favorite projects:
- [NL_TO_SQL_LLM](https://github.com/AakashB-1996/NL_TO_SQL_LLM)
- [spotify_etl_de](https://github.com/AakashB-1996/sptoify_etl_de)
- [Bank-Marketing](https://github.com/AakashB-1996/Bank-Marketing)
- [strava-api](https://github.com/AakashB-1996/strava-api)

Alongside working on various projects, I love to improve my SQL and Python skills with super fun tools like [InterviewMaster](https://www.interviewmaster.ai/home?companies=3%2C5%2C8%2C10%2C12&difficulties=medium&share=false) . Please do check it out!!!
